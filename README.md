Overview
-
This example provides the complete code to perform the following tasks:

* Data ingestion from CSV
* Data modeling
* Data processing

The directory is organized as follows:

* NSA - contains model code
* Iris.csv - sample dataset

Scenario
-
The sample dataset contains flowers that vary in three categories (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica).  The objective of the study is to train a machine learning model to predict the correct label for each flower. Three machine learning techniques were applied in this study: the Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
